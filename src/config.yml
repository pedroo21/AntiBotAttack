# AntiBotAttack
#
# By: imTedzi
# Version: BungeeCord
#
# Configuration Details
#
# * MAX-LOGINS - Max logins allowed per time defined in "PER-HOW-MUCH-SECONDS"
# * PER-HOW-MUCH-SECONDS - How much seconds should the protection detect max logins
# * ANTIBOT-TIME - How much time will the Antibot Protection kick in and prevent offline logins
# * DEBUG - You won't need to enable this :)
#
# * UNABLE-TO-LOGIN - Message that is given to the player in case an internal error occours
# * CHANGE-MOTD - In case there's a bot attack happening, do you wish to update the motd to warn the players?
# * MOTD-PROTECTION-ENABLED - To which motd?
# * OFFLINE - If your server is offline, leave this as true. If you have a mixed-mode server,
# it means you log your online players as in an online server, so put this as false.
#
# * PING - Another protection method over the default one, if you enable this, players who pinged the server (which
# means players who saw the server in the Server-List) will also be allowed in when an attack is happening (besides premium).
# However, I found there are bots who ping the server before. So if you wan't to protect against them, disable PING.
# * REFRESH-TIME - During a period of time, the plugin will refresh the whitelisted players who saw the server in the
# Server-List. You can change the time here, case of doubt, leave it as default.
# * CACHE-SIZE - Some massive bot attacks try to fill your BungeeCord RAM. To avoid that, I've set a Max CACHE-SIZE for
# whitelisted players who saw the server in the Server-List. Increasing = more valid players are allowed during bot attacks
# Case of doubt, leave it as default.
